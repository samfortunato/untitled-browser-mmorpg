# character portraits

maybe make them a visual mix of fire emblem: the blazing blade portraits, plus advanced wars 1 style?
very appealing, good looking anime.
the guys have to be hot, and the girls have to be hot, too!!

let players pick body types of male and female. but everyone has to look appealing.

let them customize some basic parameters for body.
- muscle size
- breast size for female
- hip width for female
- general height

then, keep releasing new items and shit to have highly customizable parts:
- hair styles
- accessories
- underwear
- shorts
- all clothing
- armor
- weapons

maybe you can let players easily switch between casual sets of clothing, and battle sets.
so you can look cool when you're chilling, but when you want to get down to business and do some
exploring, etc., you easily switch between sets of armor you want.

don't do anything stupid, like the fucking Wand from Animal Crossing: New Horizons!!
you should be able to just store those clothes, armor, and weapons in different "set slots".
easily switch between them!
easily swap things in and out of inventory!
can do this from anywhere! don't need to "be home" or stand in front of a mirror, or some dumb shit!!!

this is cool. you can have like a party set of clothes, a sexy set of clothes for having fun and being hot,
and like a strong set of armor/weps for fighting bosses,
a more casual set for exploring & increasing movement speed & acrobatics,
etc.
