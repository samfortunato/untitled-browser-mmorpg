put ideas here. unfinished thoughts, ideas for new features, etc.

if you want to use anything in here, take it out of the `ideas/` folder, and put it
in a better place first.

maybe put things into the `ideas/` folder, when you're first working on them.
if they mature into something cool, it graduates into the codebase, and becomes a feature, change, or addition.
