# Philosophies

a `Philosophy` is basically a Strategy, where, when applied to your character, it decides how
your stats increase upon leveling up.

the idea is that your character can have a "Philosophy" as they go through the game.
if they "value" intelligence, then their INT stat will increase more upon leveling up.
if they think strength is a more important thing, then their ATK stat will raise more upon leveling up.

the cool part is that i want players to be able to "change" their "philosophy" as they play through the game.
this is so they don't get stuck with one "philosophy" -- they can change it as they grow.

just like real life :)

this is a replacement for Race or Class in games. being stuck with a specific race or class is annoying!
often, this is how you get a certain different algorithm for how stats raise or change throughout leveling up.
ex: Mage class has low ATK, which doesn't increase that much, if at all, throughout the game.
    BUT, their INT stat or MAG stat starts out high, and increases much more so than any other class.

INSTEAD, i want to have an "Intelligence" philosophy, or a "Magical" philosophy, where, when the player decides
that's their "philosophy", then intelligence/magic will increase moreso as they level up.

then, later on, if the player grows enough in magic/int, and decides that strength is more important to them
at this time, or they just want to work on strength, they can change their "philosophy" to "value" strength more,
maybe by adopting a "Warrior" philosophy, or "Power" philosophy.
now, each time they level up, their ATK will be biased to increase more. but, they lose that buff on MAG/INT leveling up;
it now matches the algorithm for the "Warrior" philosophy they've "adopted".

(the language is important, here. it makes it fun, and makes it feel like a "real" thing, as opposed to some
detatched game mechanic! refer to it with these "real world terms" in game, too!)

## Other Info

it will be difficult, but i think a player should be able to max out all of their stats, by adopting different philosophies over time.
i don't want them to feel like they've missed out on something by picking specific philosophies. i want them to
be able to switch back and forth during the time they play the game, and eventually reach max level for all stats.

maybe make it so you have to adopt different philosophies throughout playing, in order to create this "ultimate" character file.
maybe make it so, as you gain more levels, it's harder to gain stats, even if switching philosophies.
(sort of reflecting how, as you age, it's harder to learn things and switch course).
