/**
 * Extremely rare item which will let you duplicate any crafting item you craft this with.
 * Craft item A with this item, and you get two of item A.
 *
 * Some items are exempt. Can't make it too OP!
 *
 * Could have an event, or very secret thing that randomly happens, where there's a dark gray slime that appears
 * in one area. It's really fast and annoying to kill. but if you kill it, it can drop a Reflect Putty.
 *
 * don't tell ANYONE about this. maybe make it show up in random places at random times, and change
 * the places it shows up in haha.
 *
 * very small chance of spawning a Gray Slime (slime should be dark gray)
 * */
