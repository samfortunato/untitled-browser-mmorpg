# Items

maybe don't make too many items. this can easily explode in complexity.
if you do make more, organize them into categories, so people can easily keep track of things.
if you have too many random things like "Dragoon's Snare", "Eye of Templar", etc.... wtf are these? what do they mean?
what category do they belong to? is the function/usage of the item apparent from the name?
if it isn't, it probably isn't a good thing to name your item.

the exception to this is a Special item. you can have a legion of items that are like "red/blue/green mushroom", or
"red/blue/green powder", where you have item category + level (e.g. green powder is lowest. red powder is more powerful and rare)
but then, when you have a random item that's like "The Golden Bristle", it seems special. that sounds like a key item. you
can only get one of it, and you have to use it for something, or you get an ability from it. that's an exception.

rarer things need to have rarer sounding names. common/more functional things need to have more common/functional sounding names.
you should get an idea of what the item is and what it does from the name of it.
also an idea of it's rarity and power.

## Crafting
crafting == cooking, item synthesis, etc.
lots of gems, raw materials, cool things that don't necessarily do anything on their own.
but when combined, you can get potions, buffs, weapons maybe
and some crafting items have meta effects (e.g. Reflect Putty, which duplicates any crafting item you combine it with).

### Shrooms
- mushrooms: different types have elemental effects, and status effects.

- putties: this has meta effects in crafting, when you combine putties with other items.
  - blue putty: increases the potency of a crafting item by 1.
  - lime green putty: increases the potency of a crafting item by 2.
  - shiny gray putty: increases the potency of a crafting item by 3.
  - reflect putty: extremely rare. craft it with any single crafting item to return 2x of the other crafting item.
    - make the graphics for this SO cool. like a dark gray, but iridescent and rainbow-y. make it FEEL and LOOK rare and AMAZING.
  - time putty: when combined with a recipe that produces a time limited effect, it increases the duration of that time limit.
    - varied depending on the recipe?

- powders: helpful in creating status effect potions
  - green powder: when mixed in a potion, restores HP
  - blue powder: restores MP
  - red powder: increases strength temporarily
  - shiny gray powder: ???
