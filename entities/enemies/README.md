# enemies

## slimes
- common enemy. different colors indicate different strength levels
- they can drop Putties, which are item crafting modifiers ("meta crafting items"). see item crafting readme for more info
  - light blue slime: most common. may drop a light blue putty sometimes. nothing special.
  - green slime: slightly stronger. can whip at you while jumping. can
  - gray slime: extremely rare, special slime. doesn't really attack you, but is very fast, and annoying to kill.
    - killing it drops a Reflect Putty, the rarest putty.
- make slimes of all colors. make them do different things, and drop different putties that do different things?
- make the colors REALLY nice here. i love different colored versions of the same thing!!!
